pub mod wp_presentation {
    //! timed presentation related wl_surface requests
    //!
    //! The main feature of this interface is accurate presentation
    //! timing feedback to ensure smooth video playback while maintaining
    //! audio/video synchronization. Some features use the concept of a
    //! presentation clock, which is defined in the
    //! presentation.clock_id event.
    //! 
    //! A content update for a wl_surface is submitted by a
    //! wl_surface.commit request. Request 'feedback' associates with
    //! the wl_surface.commit and provides feedback on the content
    //! update, particularly the final realized presentation time.
    //! 
    //! 
    //! 
    //! When the final realized presentation time is available, e.g.
    //! after a framebuffer flip completes, the requested
    //! presentation_feedback.presented events are sent. The final
    //! presentation time can differ from the compositor's predicted
    //! display update time and the update's target time, especially
    //! when the compositor misses its target vertical blanking period.

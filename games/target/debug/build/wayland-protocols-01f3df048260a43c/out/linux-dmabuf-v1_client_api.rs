    //! factory for creating dmabuf-based wl_buffers
    //!
    //! Following the interfaces from:
    //! https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.txt
    //! and the Linux DRM sub-system's AddFb2 ioctl.
    //! 
    //! This interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based
    //! wl_buffers. Immediately after a client binds to this interface,
    //! the set of supported formats and format modifiers is sent with
    //! 'format' and 'modifier' events.
    //! 
    //! The following are required from clients:
    //! 
    //! - Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is
    //! coherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is
    //! correctly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf
    //! implementation.
    //! 
    //! - Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the
    //! compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of
    //! the compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing
    //! dmabuf-based wl_buffer.
    //! 
    //! The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:
    //! 
    //! - The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid
    //! for the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may
    //! at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel
    //! sub-system that might accept it.
    //! 
    //! To create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a
    //! zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params
    //! request. All planes required by the intended format are added with
    //! the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is
    //! issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.
    //! 
    //! The 'create' request,
    //! - on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final
    //! wl_buffer to the client.
    //! - on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server
    //! cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.
    //! 
    //! For the 'create_immed' request,
    //! - on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to
    //! create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.
    //! - on failure, the server can choose to either:
    //! - terminate the client by raising a fatal error.
    //! - mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the
    //! client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any
    //! request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.
    //! 
    //! Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    //! backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    //! may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    //! Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    //! the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    //! Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    //! version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    //! interface version number is reset.
